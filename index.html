    <h3>Why does one play Fusiondartz?</h3>
    <p>As entertainment, or to settle arguments. Or wars.</p>

    <h3>The Rules of Fusiondartz</h3>

    <p>All participants <i>have to</i> suck at darts. Don't fake it.</p>
    <p>Who starts is decided by the person that throws closest to, or in the bulls-eye. Repeat every set.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to reach 100. Easy right? No it's not if you suck at darts.</p>
    <p>Doubles and triples count but are not required to finish a set.</p>
    <p>You decide on number of sets and games. We recommend best of three sets.</p>
    <p>Throw 69 and you win the set and start the next one. You can't aim to hit 69.</p>
    <p>Remember, Fusiondartz is a gentleman's game.</p>

    <h4>Final, but most important rule:</h4>
    <p><i>Fusiondartz must be played with a beer.</i></p>
